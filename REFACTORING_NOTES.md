# Document AI Mapper - Refactoring Summary

## What Was Done

The codebase has been completely refactored from a monolithic structure into a clean, modular architecture that's easier to understand and maintain.

## New Structure

### Before (Monolithic)
- `main.py` (551 lines) - Everything in one file
- `document_processor.py` (628 lines) - Massive class doing everything
- `search_engine.py` (183 lines) - Single class handling all search logic

### After (Modular)
```
app/
├── main.py                    # Clean FastAPI app setup
├── api/                       # API endpoints
│   ├── upload.py             # File upload handling
│   ├── search.py             # Search functionality
│   ├── categories.py         # Category management
│   └── status.py             # System status
├── models/                    # Data models
│   └── schemas.py            # Pydantic schemas
├── services/                  # Business logic
│   └── document_service.py   # Document operations
├── core/                      # Core processing modules
│   ├── text_extraction/      # Text extraction
│   │   ├── pdf_extractor.py
│   │   ├── image_extractor.py
│   │   └── extractor_factory.py
│   ├── text_processing/      # Text processing
│   │   └── text_preprocessor.py
│   ├── categorization/       # Document categorization
│   │   └── category_manager.py
│   ├── storage/              # Data storage
│   │   └── document_storage.py
│   ├── search/               # Search functionality
│   │   ├── query_processor.py
│   │   ├── relevance_calculator.py
│   │   ├── snippet_generator.py
│   │   ├── filter_manager.py
│   │   └── search_engine.py
│   └── document_processor.py # Main processor (now much smaller)
└── utils/                     # Utilities
    └── middleware.py         # Custom middleware
```

## Benefits

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each module has one clear purpose
2. **Easier Testing**: Small, focused modules are easier to test
3. **Better Maintainability**: Changes are isolated to specific modules
4. **Improved Readability**: Code is organized logically
5. **Reusability**: Components can be reused in different contexts
6. **Human-Friendly**: Comments and structure are clear and understandable

## Key Improvements

- **Separation of Concerns**: API, business logic, and core processing are separated
- **Factory Pattern**: ExtractorFactory creates appropriate text extractors
- **Modular Search**: Search functionality is broken into focused components
- **Clean APIs**: Each endpoint has its own module
- **Better Error Handling**: Errors are handled at appropriate levels
- **Consistent Logging**: Each module has its own logger

## Testing

All functionality has been tested and verified to work exactly as before, but with much cleaner, more maintainable code.

## File Sizes (Before vs After)

- `main.py`: 551 lines → 35 lines (94% reduction)
- `document_processor.py`: 628 lines → 200 lines (68% reduction)
- `search_engine.py`: 183 lines → 150 lines (18% reduction)

Total lines of code increased slightly due to better organization and documentation, but each individual file is much more manageable.
